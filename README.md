# Falcon Signature ZKP

#### `This is a test with the objective of learning the generation of ZKP with Falcon signature.`

Falcon is a lattice-based signature scheme and is a promising alternative to conventional cryptographic algorithms that could be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. (https://falcon-sign.info)

This repo contains:

- falcon-rust: a rust wrapper of falcon signature with the minimum necessary functionality
- falcon-r1cs: an R1CS implementation for falcon verification circuit with Arkwork's

> Most of the basic code is from: https://github.com/zhenfeizhang/falcon.rs
